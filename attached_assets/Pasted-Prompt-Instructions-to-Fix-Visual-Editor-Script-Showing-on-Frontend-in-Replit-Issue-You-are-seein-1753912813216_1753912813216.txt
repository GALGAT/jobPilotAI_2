Prompt / Instructions to Fix Visual Editor Script Showing on Frontend in Replit
Issue:
You are seeing the Replit visual editor or "beacon" JavaScript code or overlays appearing on your frontend application in Replit. This is likely caused by a dev tool script enabled or injected by Replit’s environment or your project setup.

Steps to fix:

Disable Replit Visual Editor Mode if Enabled:

Check if your Replit project or workspace has a "Visual Editor" or similar "Replit Beacon" feature enabled.

If available, toggle it off in your project settings, environment options, or Replit sidebar tooling.

Remove or Condition the Script That Loads the Visual Editor:

Search your code for any explicit imports or <script> tags loading the beacon/cartographer scripts (keywords might include replit-beacon, cartographer, or visually referencing visual editor scripts).

Remove or conditionally load these scripts only during development, not in production.

Check for Debug or Development Injection:

If you are using Replit’s in-browser editor tooling or plugins that inject editing/highlighting code, try disabling or opting out of those extensions or configurations.

Build your frontend with a production mode configuration that excludes dev-only scripts.

Disable Conflicting Browser Extensions (if applicable):

Sometimes browser extensions (especially those related to Replit or web development) inject these scripts. Temporarily disable your browser extensions and reload your app to test.

Check Your Build & Deployment Pipeline:

If you use bundlers or build systems (e.g., Webpack, Vite), verify that dev-only tools like the visual editor scripts are excluded or gated on environment variables (NODE_ENV !== 'production').

Add a Safe Guard in Your Code (Example):

js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  // Load or enable the visual editor script only in dev environment
  import('replit-beacon').then(module => {
    // initialize visual editor
  }).catch(console.error);
}
Consult Replit Documentation or Support:

Replit may have specific docs or config flags for turning off the visual editor or related development tools if it’s injected automatically.

Search or ask in Replit’s community for "disable visual editor on app frontend".

If you follow these steps or use this prompt as a checklist, you should be able to prevent the visual editor/minified beacon script from cluttering your app’s frontend in Replit.
